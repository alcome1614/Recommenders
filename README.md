# Recommenders

This repository contains the code of several projects done in the subject of Recommender Systems.

On the one hand the  file  `slimp.ipynb` contains Sparse Linear Methods (SLIM) for Top-N Recommender Systems. On the other hand, the file  `pagerank.ipynb`  contains the code to implement Graph-based recommender systems. More specifically it implements two personalized pagerank alogorithms that apply pagerank to recommender systems by giving emphasis to the neighbourhood of the object of study: random walk method and itemrank method.
